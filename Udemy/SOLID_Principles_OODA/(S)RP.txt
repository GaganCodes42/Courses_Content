S = Single
R = Responsibility
P = Principle
(Most important in OOPS)

Simpler Defi - It states that each class in the system should have only one responsibility.
Issue : This def. doesn't explains what responsibility is and how loose it is meaning to different people. Not very practical def. .

Better way - We should be able to describe what each class does without using 'AND' conjunction.
Not Practical but Good because - It makes focus on the main and only responsibility of the class.

Best reason - "Each class should have only one reason to change."
If we can't find a reason to change the class' responsibility in present, it is following SRP as per present.

1. This enables collaboratio - more can discuss on responsibility and SRP following of class
2. Questions about change can be escalated.

Therefore, responsibility = reason to change

More than one reason to chane = violation of SRP and leads to excessive coupling

Involvement of different stakeholders at class level functionality is an indicator of class-level funcitonality.
 - Code can't be trace to different stakeholders most of the time.
 - So extract individual responsibility into individual classes.
 - Break features into smaller classes for easier re-use.

Be-aware of OVER-ENGINEERING and BE PRAGMATIC !
Perform SRP analysis before writing code to safe refactoring effort !!!

Benefits of SRP -
1. Smaller, narrowly focused componenets.
2. Encapsutlation of the most probable changes within specific componenets.
3. Better implementation decisions.
4. Simple reuse of existing funcitonality.
5. More felxibility to codebase as whole.
