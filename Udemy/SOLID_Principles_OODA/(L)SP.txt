L = Liskov
S = Substitution
P = Principle

Simpler Defi - If S is a subtype of T, then objects of T should be replaceable by with objects of type S without altering
any of the desireable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).

Subtype - Subclass or realization which can be substituted for the type it extends or implements.
An abstraction's implementation cannot be a considered as subtype of abstraction class and are replaceable in use of talk and display.

LSP rules -

I. LSP Method Signature Rules :

1. Contravariance of arguments -
(a) If subclass implements a method from its superclass , then the number of arguments should be same.
(b) The type of each argument in subclass method should be the supertype of type of the respective argument in supertype method.
Point - Compilers enforce contravariance of arguments in statically typed programming languages.

2.Covariance of result -
Either both superclass' and subclass' methods return a result or neither does.
If there is a result, then the type of the result in subclass of is a subtype of the result in the superclass.
Point - Compilers enforce covariance of arguments in statically typed programming languages.

3. Exception Rule -
Exceptions thrown by a method in the subclass should be contained in the set of exceptions thrown by the respective method in the superclass.

 -> Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions
  1. Exception rule is enforced by the compiler for "checked exceptions".
  2. The compiler doesn't checks "unchecked" exceptions.
  (Need to check that the exception in subclass is not out of bounds to that of the superclass it inherits)

II - Pre and Post Condition Rules -
(Pre is about asssertion on state of system when module is called, whereas Post is about asssertion on state of system when module is executed)

Pre-Condition Rule : Pre-Condition required by the methods of a subclass must not be stronger than pre-conditions required by methods of superclass.
Post-condition Rule : Post-Condition garunteed by the methods of a subclass must not be weaker than post-conditions required by methods of superclass.

III - Class Property Rule -

1. Invariant Rule : Invariants garunteed by a subclass must include all invariants garunteed by a superclass.

Invariat Characteristics -
Independent of the history, relatively easy to identify and reason about -> but can't express dynamic properties of class.

2. Contraint Rule : Constrants enforced by a subclass must include all contraints enforced by a superclass.
___________________________________________________________

Rules of Thumb -

1. Don't make subclass methods' arguments more specific !
2. Don't make subclass return methods' return type more general !
3. A subclass should be able to operate in all states that a superclass can operate in.
4. Clients shouldn't be surprised by the result of invocation of methods of a subclass,

But don't apply LSP practically to all classes. To time taking. Depends on situation and need.
