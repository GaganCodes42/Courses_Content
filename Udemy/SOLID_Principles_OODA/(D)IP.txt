D = Dependency
I = Inversion
P = Principle

Simple Defi - High level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
                                              AND
              Abstractions should not depend on details and details should depend on abstractions.

Point - Abstractions invert dependencies between classes.

DIP benefits:
1. Break depedency on the schedule of another componenet/external modules.
2. Easier integration.
3. Increased visibility and better accountability.
4. Reusability.
5. Protection from future changes in requirements.

DIP costs -
1. More effort to implement.
2. More effort to change.
3. Increased code complexity due to integration.

Don't use DIP for sake of it !!! but inverted dependencies benefits are more than the costs if used judiciously.
