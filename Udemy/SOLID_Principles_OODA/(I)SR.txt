I = Interface
S = Segregation
P = Principle

Principle of least knowledge and information hiding.

Simple Defi - Clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they don't use.
Can divide the main functionanlity of the function into different abstractions and then implemented accordingly.

Pub-Sub system follows OCP and ISP both.

Benefits of ISP -
1. Explicit and clear dependencies
2. More readable code without puzzling empty methods.
3. Easy to find all clients which are interested in a specific message (from Pub-Sub example) = means easy to find a issue related to a specific function.
4. Safe and easy addition of new features in the features.

High Level Benefits of ISP -
1.Communicate what clients do with their services.
2.Communicate what clients don't do with their services.
3.Restrict what clients can do with their services.
4.Segregated interfaces allow to segregate functionanlity if/when needed.
